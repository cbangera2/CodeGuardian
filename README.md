Imagine a world where over 60% of computer science students rely on AI to complete coding assignments, not just for help but as a crutch, compromising the very foundation of their future careers. This isn't a hypothetical scenario; it's happening now, threatening to undermine the essence of programming education. This crisis of academic integrity and the devaluation of genuine programming skills present a significant challenge for educators and employers alike.

This is where we at codeGuardian step in.  We're a VSCode extension that acts as a guardian angel for academic integrity. We track every edit in your code, creating an immutable timeline that exposes any attempts at cheating. 

This helps:
- Students: Master coding fundamentals by actively learning, not copy-pasting from ChatGPT.
- Educators: Focus on mentoring and nurturing talent, not policing code submissions.
- Employers: Confidently hire graduates with genuine coding skills, not AI-ghostwritten scripts.

The market for CodeGuardian is vast and growing, as coding bootcamps, universities, and online learning platforms all face the challenge of maintaining academic integrity in the face of advancing AI. The future of coding education is at a crossroads, and by investing in CodeGuardian, you're not just funding a product; you're championing a cause. We invite you to join us in this mission to build a future where genuine coding talent is nurtured, valued, and shines brighter than ever. Invest in CodeGuardian, and let's ensure that academic integrity and genuine skill development remain at the heart of programming education.
